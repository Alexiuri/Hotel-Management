This is the skeleton of the project.
Project contains three modules: domain, persistence and web using springboot.
All three modules are built using Maven.
Domain is used for models, dto's and entities.
Persistence is used for storing, accessing, and managing Java objects in a relational database. 
In future I will used MySql. Now the datas are mocked.
The web module is for rest services in order to use them on front-end.
For front-end I use angular.
